# Netflix UI Clone — Frontend Practice Project

A pixel‑inspired recreation of the Netflix landing page interface built using **pure HTML5 and CSS3**.
This project focuses on understanding how production‑level landing pages are structured, layered, and made responsive without relying on frameworks or JavaScript.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The purpose of this project is to reverse‑engineer a real commercial website UI in order to develop strong core front‑end fundamentals.
Instead of using libraries, the layout is handcrafted to deeply understand browser rendering behavior and layout mechanics.

Key learning goals:

* Semantic HTML structuring
* Layout architecture
* Visual hierarchy reproduction
* CSS positioning & stacking contexts
* Responsive design principles

## 🧠 Core Concepts Practiced

### Layering & Overlays

Using absolute positioning and opacity to create cinematic background contrast.

### Media Framing Technique

Embedding video inside a device image using relative‑absolute positioning and percentage alignment.

### Layout Systems

Combination of Flexbox and Grid to replicate real product layout behavior.

### Responsiveness

Media queries convert horizontal sections into stacked mobile layout while preserving spacing rhythm.
